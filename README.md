## Features
- Enter a location to find the UV index and category.
- Displays whether sunscreen is needed based on the UV index.
- Shows the exact address of the searched location.
- Error handling with user-friendly error messages.
- Easy-to-use interface with a main page, location input page, and results page.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine.
- API keys for Google Geocoding API and OpenUV API.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:chayboats/sunscreen-api-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```
   cd suncreen-api-project
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:  
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:  
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
   OPENUV_API_KEY=your_openuv_api_key
   ```

### Usage
1. Start the server:  
   ```
   node index.js
   ```
2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to start using the app.

## Technologies Used
- **Express**: For building the server-side logic.
- **EJS**: For rendering dynamic HTML pages.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables securely.
- **body-parser**: For handling form data submitted by users.
- **Google Geocoding API**: For converting location names into latitude and longitude coordinates.
- **OpenUV API**: For retrieving UV index information based on coordinates.

## What I Learned
Building Screentime allowed me to gain hands-on experience with API integration, error handling, and managing environment variables. I also enhanced my skills in building user-friendly interfaces with Express and EJS.

## Continued Development
- Improve error messages to be more specific, e.g., handling rate limit errors from APIs.
- Enhance the UI for a better user experience.
- Add more detailed UV-related advice based on the UV index category.
- Improve desktop design

## Acknowledgements
Thank you to the developers of the Google Geocoding API and OpenUV API for providing the essential data used in this app.
